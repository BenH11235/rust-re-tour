# Rust Binary Analysis, Feature by Feature

This is a companion git repository for the blog post "Rust Binary Analysis, Feature by Feature" (link will be available upon blog post's publication).

## Usage

To build a sample program from source, you need `cargo` (basically for our purposes this is the Rust compiler). Clone the repository, then enter the directory of the program you are interested in (e.g. `0_basic_pl_concepts`) and run `cargo build`. Alternately, the exact binaries analyzed in the blog post are available in the "releases" section of this repository.
